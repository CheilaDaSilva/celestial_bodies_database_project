## Project goal: 
Build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.

Project made as part of the FreeCodeCamp <b> Relational Databases Beta Certificate course </b>



This is a "sample" relational database created on SQL as part of the Freecodecamp Relational Databases Beta Certificate course. 
For this project I created tables to track some characteristics for the following celestial bodies:
Galaxies, Stars, Planets and Moons.
